# Polyglot Data Science: The Force Awakens

Data science is a polyglot discipline, and requires you to
master a wide range of tools. In this hands-on and fun workshop we'll cover:

 - Analyzing data with R: The R language is the go-to tool for statistical
   computation and has a wide range of packages ready to use. You'll learn
   some R and use it to analyze social network data

 - Accessing data with F# and type providers: No matter whether your data is
   in a database, exposed via a REST service or in a local CSV, XML or JSON file,
   type providers make it super easy to read it and get it ready for analysis

 - Visualizing data with D3: To present the results, we're going to build elegant
   HTML5 visualizations using the D3 library. This is the leading library used
   for building interactive web-based visualizations.

In the workshop you'll learn important data science skills that apply to a wide
range of areas from analysis of customer behavior, to advertising on social networks.

Did we say fun? Indeed, one of the main datasets will come from a social network
of characters from the latest Star Wars movie, _The Force Awakens_. We'll
identify who is the most important person according to different measures, and
who talks to the largest number of people. Do the light and dark sides form
separate communities? And who connects them?

## Software installation

This will be a hands-on workshop, so be sure to come with a laptop with
everything installed!

### F# with an editor of your choice

Follow the instructions on [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org) for
[Mac](http://fsharp.org/use/mac), [Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows) or
[Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux). On Mac, we recommend Xamarin
Studio or Ionide; on Windows, we recommend Visual Studio.

 1. **Xamarin (Mac/Windows).** [Download Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/download). This
   automatically installs mono and F#, so it should give you all you need.

 2. or **Atom with Ionide (Mac/Windows).** Follow the installation instructions
   in "Getting started" on [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) page. You'll need to
   install mono (Mac and Linux) or F# (Windows) and [Atom](http://atom.io).
   Then install the `ionide-installer` package.

 3. or **Visual Studio (Windows).** You can get the free
   [Visual Studio Community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).
   This is a big download, so make sure to get it before the workshop!

### R with R Studio.

For the second part, we will be using R. You need to download R itself and we
recommend getting RStudio, which is a nice editor for using R.

 1. **R project.** Get the latest version of R from
   [www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org). Pick any mirror on the
   download page. They are all the same!

 2. **R Studio.** Download [R Studio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
   You can use the free open-source edition for the workshop.
